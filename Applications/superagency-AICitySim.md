# Grant Proposal: Super Agency - AICitySim

**Project Name:**  
Super Agency - AICitySim

**Proposal Category:**  
AI on NEAR

**Individual or Entity Name:**
GLOA / Super Agency
Sea Ansley with Jarred Taylor

---

## Project Description

**AICitySim** is a simulation engine that populates a virtual city with AI and human avatars to help startups, marketers, and researchers test their products, campaigns, and strategies in a dynamic and scalable way.

Companies can submit marketing material or products into **AICitySim**, where AI citizens — each with unique, pre-programmed personas and behaviors — interact with the campaign. Their reactions, feedback, and engagement are logged and parsed for insights.

Real humans can also join the simulation via NEAR wallet login, participate in specific test campaigns, and earn micropayments. Our MVP will be a **text-based simulation**, but designed to expand into 3D, XR, and NFT-based environments in future iterations.

## Grant Deliverables (MVP Scope)

- ✅ Simulate interactions from 1,000+ AI "citizens"
- ✅ NEAR Wallet login for real user authentication
- ✅ Campaign submission flow for brands and testers
- ✅ Swappable LLM engine to compare AI model behavior
- ✅ Insight summary dashboard with early visualizations
- ✅ Human tester participation prototype with NEAR incentives

---

## Value to the NEAR Ecosystem

- **NEAR Wallet Login** — for seamless human interaction and identity
- **Micropayments** — rewarding real humans for participating in market testing
- **LLM behavior logs** — optional on-chain metadata for transparency and AI training
- **NFT-ready** — citizens and city land plots can become evolving assets
- **Attracts startups & researchers** — building on NEAR with real business value
