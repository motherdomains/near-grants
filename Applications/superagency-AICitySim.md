# Grant Proposal: Super Agency - AICitySim

**Project Name:**  
Super Agency - AICitySim

**Proposal Category:**  
AI on NEAR

**Individual or Entity Name:**  
GLOA / Super Agency  
Sea Ansley with Jarred Taylor

---

## Project Description

**AICitySim** is a simulation engine that populates a virtual city with AI and human avatars to help startups, marketers, and researchers test their products, campaigns, and strategies in a dynamic and scalable way.

Companies can submit marketing material or products into **AICitySim**, where AI citizens ‚Äî each with unique, pre-programmed personas and behaviors ‚Äî interact with the campaign. Their reactions, feedback, and engagement are logged and parsed for insights.

Real humans can also join the simulation via NEAR wallet login, participate in specific test campaigns, and earn micropayments. Our MVP will be a **text-based simulation**, but designed to expand into 3D, XR, and NFT-based environments in future iterations.

---

## Grant Deliverables (MVP Scope)

- ‚úÖ Simulate interactions from 1,000+ AI "citizens"
- ‚úÖ NEAR Wallet login for real user authentication
- ‚úÖ Campaign submission flow for brands and testers
- ‚úÖ Swappable LLM engine to compare AI model behavior
- ‚úÖ Insight summary dashboard with early visualizations
- ‚úÖ Human tester participation prototype with NEAR incentives

---

## Value to the NEAR Ecosystem

- **NEAR Wallet Login** ‚Äî for seamless human interaction and identity
- **Micropayments** ‚Äî rewarding real humans for participating in market testing
- **LLM behavior logs** ‚Äî optional on-chain metadata for transparency and AI training
- **NFT-ready** ‚Äî citizens and city land plots can become evolving assets
- **Attracts startups & researchers** ‚Äî building on NEAR with real business value

### üîê NEAR Wallet Benefits

- **Frictionless Login**  
  Real humans can easily join campaigns using `yourname.near`, with no new account needed. This creates continuity between simulation sessions and builds persistent identity over time.

- **Verifiable Participation**  
  Every AI or human participant can be uniquely identified via wallet address, allowing us to prevent fraud and track cumulative behavior.

- **Micropayments & Rewards**  
  Incentives are seamlessly delivered using NEAR's low-cost, high-speed transactions ‚Äî ideal for rewarding humans in small bursts across many tests.

- **NFT-based Evolution**  
  Citizens (AI or human) can receive **NFTs as badges, achievements, or artifacts** tied to their simulated experience.  
  ‚Üí A human who participates in 10 campaigns might unlock a collectible NFT.  
  ‚Üí An AI avatar might evolve its characteristics based on earned NFTs.

- **Optional Bring-Your-Own-NFT Identity**  
  In future phases, testers or researchers could import their own avatar NFTs into the simulation and track how those personas perform in campaigns ‚Äî creating crossover use cases between AICitySim and other NFT communities.

## Risks & Mitigation

- **LLM Output Variability**  
  Different language models may produce inconsistent or biased feedback.  
  üîπ *Mitigation*: Include a variety of LLMs and document model bias during early testing.

- **User Engagement Dropoff**  
  Human testers may lose interest or fail to participate regularly.  
  üîπ *Mitigation*: Use NEAR Wallet-based incentives and a dynamic notification system to re-engage.

- **Scaling Simulation Logic**  
  Expanding from 1,000 to 1 million agents may introduce performance or complexity issues.  
  üîπ *Mitigation*: Start with modular design, attempt smaller virtual "focus groups", and optimize based on simulation loads during Phase 1.

- **Token/Economic Abuse**  
  Users may try to game the system to earn rewards without meaningful input.  
  üîπ *Mitigation*: Monitor behavior with usage caps and integrate quality metrics.
